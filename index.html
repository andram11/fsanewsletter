        <h2>Is your job really important ?</h2>

            The answer to this question is most likely ‘yes’ (although, lets not kid ourselves, automatization could hurt us more than we care to admit).
            <br /><br />
            The question in itself implies that there exist jobs that matter more than others. Although it is quite obviously subjective, some argue that their job has more purpose than others. Could the titans of our industry offer us purpose? 
            <br /><br />
            For the sake of argument, let’s say that the current pandemic is not our biggest enemy right now. Sure, you cannot go to the pub and grab that pint on Monday that God knows we all need. True, the consequences of the pandemic are far from measurable. 
            <br /><br />
            However, influential people like  Bill Gates have given some explicit interviews stating that the biggest threat is climate change. Not taking the word of Bill Gates for granted, let us consider the latest report of the United Nations Environment Programme press release: ‘Climate change has not stopped for COVID19’ (Programme, 2020).
            <br /><br />
            Although the purpose of this article is not to argue about this broad subject, I personally believe that the current pandemic could teach us a couple of lessons on resilience, consequences and most importantly, how it impacts your daily life. 
            <br /><br />
            As an example, I’m at a client, where although like many ‘big ones’ have a go-green policy, still have an enormous carbon footprint. Definitely, it will part of my criteria, in the future, to be mindful of whether the institution I choose to work for is mindful of the challenges we face as a generation.
            <br /><br />
            As reported on a Guardian article, companies in North Europe note that ‘people are seeking jobs with actual purpose’. As the article reports “polluting industries are having trouble attracting the right people to help them future proof their business” (Turns, 2020).
            <br /><br />
            Reducing the carbon footprint, according the Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation report of 2019, depends on adopting a circular economy in five main areas food plastic, steel, aluminum and cement (Turns, 2020). Even in the banking industry, there has been a surge in demand on ‘green-products’.
            <br /><br />
            Personally, wishing to invest not only my money in greener investments, I truly wish to invest my time energy and knowledge in what I believe to be meaningful projects.
            <br /><br />
            It would seem though, that this is a luxury we cannot all afford.

        <h2>Tulip mania – The first economic bubble</h2>

            With the context of today, experts are no longer wondering whether there will be a global financial crisis or not, but rather how huge, serious and what long-term consquences will be. This topic was a matter of debate even before the pandemic arised, so let's just imagine how the economists must be worried now.  
            <br /><br />
            This is a subject that is coming up very often on the highlights for decades. Witnessed by history, economic crises tend to arise regularly, and there are always accompanied with words : uncertainty, speculation and bankruptcy, but as the famous writer Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes) said : 'Nothing is new in this world, everything has already happened'
            <br /><br />
            Thus, today a bit of economic history on the topic, and I would like to bring you back to the XVII century. Obviously the described case is generalized, influenced by many complex factors, that I will not be describing here.
            <br /><br />
            Have you ever wondered where the first 'noted' economic crisis occurred ? At that time, the two current global powers obviously didn't have the same influence : the US - was still a bunch of colonists under the British rule and China was facing another dynastic war. It has happened in Europe, just next to our homes, in the Netherlands. If you would take a moment to think what is the country famous for, I'm sure that the flowers would come to your mind (even if probably not as the first thing).
            <br /><br />
            Across that century, the Dutch Republic was one of the most prosperous state in the world, its merchant fleet was the biggest in Europe and they were pioneers in what we can call the modern finance, in fact the first stock exchanges have been created in Amsterdam, Antwerp and Bruges – this period is known as the Golden Dutch Age. Who could then predicted that the crisis will be caused by…flowers ?
            <br /><br />
            The tulips arrived to Europe from the Ottoman Empire in the middle of the XVI century and became very popular in the country of our neighbors from the North, especially among the middle class that was getting richer and the aristocracy. The flower, different then others at time in Europe, was distinguishing with an untypical color, quite rapidly became a very desired good and his bulb started to exchanged on the stock markets. As the demand was very high, a lot of Dutch were speculating on it and even futures markets were created (you could buy a bulb at the end of the season for a fixed price).
            <br /><br />
            However at the peak of its popularity, a virus has attacked the tulips, (today known as Tulip Breaking Virus, which has been found out much later), which caused a change of the form, and make them wilting faster. People were competing with each other to obtain the most unique and rare kind of this flower – it became a luxury good, which was a symbol of the social status. People even started to sell the tulips that were already planted, which has, mainly, led to a speculative bubble. Here are the prices (currency at that time) of one tulip bulb so you can visualize clearly the fluctuations :
            <br /><br />
            1623 (year)  - 1000 (Dutch Guilders)
            <br /><br />
            1635 – 6000
            <br /><br />
            1637 – 10000 (roughly 4500 euros)            
            <br /><br />
            In comparison, 8 pigs costed 240 Guilders.
            <br /><br />
            In 1637, the prices were so high that the demand has finally started to decrease, moreover many contractors were unable to fulfill their obligations on the futures market. Combined with a plague that occurred at the same period in the country, people were no longer willing to purchase the flower.
            <br /><br />
            The bubble had burst.
            <br /><br />
            As I mentioned earlier this is the first « noted » case, but for sure not the first in general, and the financial crisis from 2008 is certainly not the last. Just think about the analogies with the previous ones, the financial market has proved to be vulnerable in so many ways, for centuries nothing has changed ! Flowers, oil, sub-primes…what's next ?
            <br /><br />
            Doyle was right, nothing is new in this world.

            Check out the testimonial of one of our Intyssers: 
            <br /><br />
           <i> Big Data Fundamentals is an EDX e-learning that you will love if you have a strong interest in data analysis. In order to feel confortable while following this course, I would recommend you to have a strong background in statistics, a good knowledge data analysis best practices, and some knowledge of programming languages (exercises in Java). The course is not business-centered at all. The aim of this e-learning is to give you some theoretical understanding of big data analysis/handling. There will also be a lot of quite interesting but complicated tests and assignments to perform in order to validate the course.  In conclusion, even though this course is quite demanding regarding time and efforts, it's worth to be followed for the most motivated ones.</i>
