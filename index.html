            This year has been unique, to say the least.
            <br /><br />
            However, we have had more members join our practice meetings than ever before. That’s a huge win!
            <br /><br />
            Thank you to everybody who participated, contributed, shared, came up with ideas, stuck with us and continued being there. Without every single one of you, there wouldn’t be an FSA Practice.
            <br /><br />
            We wish you and all your loved ones much happiness, health, success, and well-being! 
            <br /><br />

        <h2>Remote first</h2>
        <h6>Written by Andra Mertilos</h6>
        <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In March 2020, together with my colleague Cédric, we wrote and published an article called "Black Swan Pandemic". In it, we were recommending that, in order to resiliently survive such events as a pandemic, in the future, companies would need to adopt the remote work mentality in their culture: recognize it, encourage it and reward it. 
            <br /><br />
            This month, after long and uncomfortable hours spent sitting in my dining room chair, working, I started pondering if I should buy an office chair or not. My lower back said "yes!" but my brain kept saying "no, this is temporary". But here we are 9 months later, enough time to even have a baby for some people, and this is not temporary anymore.
            <br /><br />
            I recently came across an article which inspired my writing this month: the 5 levels of remote work by Matt Mulenweg, available <a href='https://think-boundless.com/five-levels-remote-work/'>here</a>. 
            <br /><br />
            I am not going to replicate his article or ideas here, I highly encourage you to read it because it is very interesting.
            <br /><br />
            It made me think that my stubbornness in believing this remote working situation is temporary led me to be in a constant state of awaiting: for the world to change back, for the events to stop unfolding, for time to move faster. 
            <br /><br />
            I had expectations, for the world to stay "normal", instead of "new normal". Having expectations is bad because you put your own well being in the hands of the world. And this year, the world operated with two broken hands.
            <br /><br />
            Matt mentions "remote first" in his article: remote work isn’t just being able to work from home or being open to "homeworking" policies. Remote first has to slowly become a new word in our vocabularies. When we want to organize an event, a drink, a get together, we first need to think how to do it remotely. I, and everyone else, can no longer afford to sit idle and wait for a miracle to happen: we have to adapt to this mentality and turn the obstacle that is the 2020 events into the way to get there, to success. Like stoics do.
            <br /><br />
            And for me, it starts with something small, like admitting I must buy myself an office chair. What about you, how are you going remote first?

            While we are still locked down in our homes, and as it seems that most European governments will probably need a couple more months before loosening, I believe that reading remains one of the favorite activities, for many of us.
            <br /><br />
            Therefore, as this atypical year 2020 comes to an end, I'd like to share with you my recommendation of some books on the topics of management/economic/psychology that I've read this year :
            <br /><br />
            <b>Capital in the twenty-first century</b> by <i>Thomas Piketty</i> «orig. Le capital au XXIe siècle ». A must for the economic history lovers. Released in 2013, a milestone book, which is the first to describe in great detail the history of economic inequalities and income distribution. Piketty is providing a deep analysis on why the world we live in is the way it is, why some countries are richer than the others, and most importantly he's trying to answer whether the wealth distribution has been mostly influenced by economic or rather by political factors. The author, who was one of the economic advisors of the previous French President François Hollande, is known to be the originator of the controversial 75% tax income in France for the richest part of the society.
             <br /><br />
             <b>The mind map book</b> by <i>Tony Buzan</i>. The author is the inventor of mind mapping – I'm sure that most of you are already familiar with this concept. His first, revolutionary book titled « Use your head » released in 1974 has been a phenomenal success. It has provided a completely novel tool for mastering the memory efficiency and has changed the way of learning forever. Buzan has mainly concentrated on the mind mapping creation process and gone deeper into the description of its usage. If you didn't have the opportunity to read his first book, I'd rather encourage to start with that one, so you can already learn some basics. I'm absolutely convinced that using mind mapping could be very useful in the consultancy work as we are facing many changes, from a daily perspective at the client office to the beginning of a completely new mission. To sum up, it is required from us need to show a certain level of flexibility, which means among others the ability to absorb a lot of information in a short time, but also to know how to operate it in an efficient way.
            <br /><br />
            <b>The Shoe Dog</b> by <i>Phil Knight</i>. I will finish the list with an autobiography. How many of you have heard the name of the founder of one of the most powerful brands ever ? I guess that only few, to be honest I didn't know it before my brother has lend me this book. One of the richest men on Earth is also a very discreet person, it is actually the very first time that Knight is telling the story on how he had the idea to create this emblematic brand. As he stated, he didn't have a very passionate life, but at one moment he was able to link his passion for travelling and professional running with the desire to create something special, and thus he ended up from being an accounting assistant teacher at the university to the guy who had challenged and took over Adidas. I think that his story deserves to be better known. Instead of proclaiming his achievements, Knight is not ashamed of talking about his weaknesses and insecurities, which makes this book very special, from a human perspective.
            <br /><br />
            I would like to thank you all for the this 2020, it was for sure a challenging year for all of us, but I'm sure that very soon, we will be able to meet physically again and to enjoy our events together, so take care & stay safe, have a great Christmas and see you in 2021 !

        <h2>Christmas shopping and the double-standards of local economies</h2>
        <h6>Written by Carlos Escobedo</h6>
        <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
        <div class="content">
           <p>This Christmas, I will be spending my time in someone’s backyard, while being absolutely careful not to over-drink (we cannot use their indoor bathrooms, remember?) and peeking through the window to catch a glimpse at what I imagine, is a beautifully decorated tree.
            <br /><br />
            That being out of the way, I will have to find a way to buy the presents without a) being contaminated b) supporting my local economy c) respecting curfew d) ordering everything online.
            <br /><br />
            Trêve de mondanités. What and most importantly, how are we supposed to buy our presents this year? The flickering hope of being actually able to share a present with our loved ones is in danger (or is it?), which is why I am writing this article. 
            <br /><br />
            End of November, the  beheerstrategie or plainly put, the control strategy. To my surprise, this document, contained many indicators that needed to be achieved, for example, positivity rate had to be less than 3%, incidence rate had to be less than 100 per 100.000 people. What you and I will remember out of this, though, is that the stores opened. Today, cases are rising again. Today, the Netherlands and Germany go back on full lockdown.
            <br /><br />
            Yes, I am a big supporter of my local economy. As a reminder, local economies as defined by Charles El-Zeind refer to a market and networking system that are part of a specific community. Indeed, as Charles mentions, these interactions create and reinforce the feeling of belonging to a community, ultimately increasing the level of social capital.
            <br /><br />
            When shops opened in the town I live in, Louvain-la-Neuve, I foolishly ventured to the mall, like half of the Walloon Brabant. I ended up queueing for several minutes (or hours?) just to go in to FNAC, Delhaize or others. Silly me, those stores are big chains.
            <br /><br />
            What pushed me to write this article, is the irony of the situation. Consciously trying to avoid big online retailers, whilst telling myself I should really avoid crowds, so the city center. The authorities opened up non-essential stores, whilst telling us to chose between our mother or father for Christmas. 
            <br /><br />
            Fully aware that the decision is not easy for the authorities, I am really just a concerned citizen struggling on whether I can, or if it is even worth it. 
            <br /><br />
            In the end, I feel as if they are struggling between keeping the economy alive and keeping us healthy. The worst thing is, I understand. I understand that they cannot fully commit to either solution because either one is going to be met with unrest and quite frankly, despair. Local economies are struggling because of different confinements and there is a double standard telling you to buy local (go stand in a line with a grandma who stands close, oh so very close to you). Or buy from the internet? Avoid chains, but still go to a small shop at the city center for a non-essential Christmas shop? The line becomes blurry.
            <br /><br />
            I am not one to end on gloomy notes or heed warnings without hope. We made it this far, we can still go the extra mile. If we act responsibly, there’s a balance to be found. My Dear Intyssers, as few as you may actually read these lines, I say to you: Merry Christmas and hope you find a way to adapt, as humanity has taught us.

            <br /><br />
           <i> I really enjoyed this e-learning , the modules of the training are well structured, you do not need any background on Agile although I would recommend you to take the training Agile & Scrum Foundations given by Andra Mertillos to wrap up the all the Agile cake basics. 
            This training will suit you if as myself are confronted to an organizational change toward Agile in your team & client's company.  This e-learning provides some tips and useful guidance to level up yourself and your agile team! This training has quizzes after all the modules and a final quizz for the certification, no assignments therefore you can go through it easily and fast.
