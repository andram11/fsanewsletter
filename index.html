          <p>
            You have probably read a very similar article on the Guardian or
            watched a FOX News enlightening broadcast (if you’re into that kind
            of news). As have you all, I worked remotely for the last couple of
            months. The question that I often wondered, in the comfort of my
            tiny apartment, was: how long is this going to last?
            <br /><br />
            No one really has the answer. As I rushed to hoard toilet paper,
            beer and canned food, we stockpiled it in our shelves for what we
            thought was going to be a short month. I find myself writing this
            six months later.
            <br /><br />
            As a consultant, you’re told you will work from home. During my
            first ‘qualif’ I dared ask if they would allow us to, as I had been
            sold to the idea. The answer ‘no’ followed a straight-faced ‘we are
            a sensitive team that always needs to be physically here’.
            <br /><br />
            As a matter of fact, we are a (as upper-management would call us)
            ‘highly-critical-team’. The nature of my work, although essential,
            had a very justifiable reason not be done from home. That being
            said, here I sit, staring at my own reflection in my computer; in my
            own home.
            <br /><br />
            The Belgian government, in the early stages of the pandemic, deemed
            it an implicit obligation for employers to provide the means to
            telework. Now, although it remains a reality for most of us, it is
            mostly a recommendation. Deconfinement brought an easing-up of all
            the imposed measures.
            <br /><br />
            Since the very beginning of this we never stopped going into the
            office, going in every two weeks.
            <br /><br />
            What stuck with me the most though, was management’s focus and
            keenness on returning into the office as soon as we could. When it
            came down to it, I had absolutely no say. Of course, I was given the
            choice to say ‘I-do-not-feel-comfortable-coming’, but uttering those
            words meant being a sort of pariah. Did I really have a choice? Is
            teleworking here to stay?
            <br /><br />
            Working from home and moving into the office again, at least for my
            experience is a two-fold reason: making it easy once we are there
            for anything that needs to be done physically (and not end up
            accumulating endless chores) and ultimately to me, the most
            important thing, we need a break from this weirdness and feel as if
            all was well.
            <br /><br />
            For ethical reasons and out of respect from my colleagues and
            superiors I will not go into many details. But some seem to get
            easily bored at home. After 27 episodes of the Big Bang Theory, they
            got bored. Granted, the choice of activities is limited. But for me,
            being home is a blessing. Right after work, I can cook, I can go
            biking, I can watch my (dummy) rabbit run around, I can focus on
            myself. Isn’t our work a big distraction? When at work, you spend,
            at least 10 hours (with commute time) focusing on that activity.
            While home, you reduce that time. I have found that some colleagues
            lack a certain passion. Thus, not knowing how to spend that time
            [1], focus it on work.
            <br /><br />
            Granted, going back to work for us is Business related. We do
            benefit from taking ourselves a load off our backs by going the
            extra day. However, I know that it is not the only reason. I know
            that as social creatures, we do enjoy going to the office, laughing
            with our colleagues and drinking the not-so-tasty coffee from the
            kitchen. The worst part is? I don’t disagree. I love working from
            home, but other than a furry colleague (my lazy rabbit) and my
            girlfriend that as a teacher, went back to teach, I rather enjoy
            seeing my colleagues.

            What’s the first thing you think about when reading this title? 2, 6
            billions? Intel did a massive AI purchase a couple of years ago of a
            company called Habana (Israel-based) for a similar price.
            <br /><br />
            Or perhaps you would think that this is a number related with a
            great ecological plan, for example the number of trees that need to
            be planted in a country that is suffering from an alarming
            biodiversity negligence? In Kazakhstan a such plan has been indeed
            formulated and proposed recently by its government.
            <br /><br />
            With the context of today, have you heard about the news regarding
            the potential yearly number of a COVID-vaccine (a vaccine-candidate
            by the way) provided by Novavax by mid-2021 ? Yes, you're right!
            That would exceed two billions as well!
            <br /><br />
            The answer, as it turns out, is tangibly about us.
            <br /><br />
            2 609 228 160 is the number of seconds an average person in Belgium
            lives. One of the few numbers that is constantly decreasing during
            our lifetime.
            <br /><br />
            1..2..3..can you feel it?
            <br /><br />
            When you think about life like this, it looks even shorter than it
            is. Cherish all the good moments, especially during this weird time.
            Tomorrow we might be irritated by having to, yet again, work at
            home, locked with the family. But every single second we live, we
            live it only once.
            <br /><br />
            4...5...6...
            <br /><br />
            I know that my colleague Carlos wrote an article about the pain
            related with the choice of being present at the office. For people
            like Carlos and yourself, potentially discouraged by such a choice,
            I'd like to remind you that humanity has won against worse
            pandemics, and it is a matter of a time before we retake our normal
            lives back.
            <br /><br />
            7...8...9...
            <br /><br />
            What I warmly invite you to do is to take this number and make it
            the best seconds of your life.

        <h2>How to get things done</h2>
        <h6>Written by Andra Mertilos</h6>
        <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
        <div class="content">
           <p> During my almost 10 years of experience as a working professional, I
            have noticed a peculiar trend: almost all of my colleagues have the
            gift of coming up with wonderful ideas but only 1% of them actually
            end up implementing them.
            <br /><br />
            When I ask why, the most common answer I get is this:
            <i>I just didn’t have the time</i>. <br /><br />
            Classic.
            <br /><br />
            Without wanting to create the impression of arrogance or sounding
            conceited, I am most known (inside and outside of work) for doing
            what I said I would do, about 90% of the time.
            <br /><br />
            I would like to share with you how I do that and hopefully maybe
            nudge you into the direction of making your ideas a reality.
            <br /><br />
            The most valuable asset we have is time. But time is actually a
            mental construct. Time is literally a way we manage our mind around
            each day.
            <br /><br />
            Time doesn’t change, but the way you think about it will change your
            experience of time. My default thinking about time is: I have plenty
            of it!
            <br /><br />
            This is why one hour “feels” different from another depending on
            what we are thinking and therefore experiencing. An hour of traffic
            “feels” very different from an hour watching a great movie. The hour
            is exactly the same amount of time, but it feels different, and
            therefore we say it is different. Time slows down or speeds up based
            on how we think about it.
            <br /><br />
            So the way to actually get things done and take the time to put in
            the effort of bringing your ideas to reality is to approach time as
            something we create instead of something we spend.
            <br /><br />
            Here are the main ways we spend time: worrying, people-pleasing,
            confused, indecise, judging ourselves and others, regretting,
            feeling overwhelmed.
            <br /><br />
            Here is how I personally create time:
            <ul>
                <li>
                  I make decisions STRONGLY: if you’ve ever been in a meeting with
                  me, you should know I always ask for a deadline and the expected
                  output. This way, I don’t waste time second guessing or being
                  confused
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once I make a decision, I will take massive action: massive action
                  means doing and doing until I get it done. Whether it is testing,
                  failing, starting over, doing something different, I just do. I
                  don’t think about doing, or wait to do something or talk about it,
                  I just do
                </li>
                <li>
                  I plan a certain amount of time to get something done, and then
                  that is the amount of time it gets. I don’t give myself the luxury
                  of seeing how long something takes. Even when it’s something I
                  don’t know how to do, I give myself a time limit and do my best to
                  meet it
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am willing to learn by failing: this is what eliminates the need
                  to get stuck in indecision. And let me tell you a secret: the
                  moment you learn how to fail, you stop failing. It’s magic
                </li>
                <li>I say no to things that cost me time (check the list above)</li>
                <li>
                  I expect everything to be HARD: I am learning (ongoing process,
                  still not there yet) to greet frustration and defeat with open
                  arms. Yeah, it’s hard. So hard. But I’m still going to do it
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>     I want to use my time to bring my ideas to life. I want to say: hey,
                that thought was in my mind and now it’s real, how awesome. That is my
                main motivator for getting things done.
                <br /><br />
                Now it’s your turn. What do you want to use your time for?</p>
