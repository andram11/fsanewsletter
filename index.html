            <h2>Coronavirus, Real-Estate & Banks: an analysis</h2>

                Many things may have gone wrong in the last decade but certainly not the expansion of the economic activity which has grown every year by 2.978% in average since 2010 (data Banque Mondiale). Sad to say but this is unlikely to happen for 2020. The abrupt appearance of the Covid-19 pandemic will most likely reverse the current trend as the virus constrained many countries to put in place lockdown measures to preserve the public health at the expense of the economy.
                <br><br>
                Likewise, the collapse of the economic activity can have a major impact on the real estate market in Belgium. Up to now, the Belgian government is supporting the companies and the households going through the crisis with measures such as the partial unemployment. Real estate not being an exception, the prices are driven by the laws of supply and demand and on the long run, it is likely that some people will lose their job and have lower revenues negatively impacting the demand. At the same time, some other people will be unable to pay off their mortgage which will lead to an increase in supply.
                <br><br>
                This is beyond a doubt a positive news for everyone looking at becoming a property owner, but this is as well very risky for banks which will need to monitor closely the future of the real estate market. If remembering how the 2008 financial crisis initially began is probably unnecessary, it is imperative to highlight that this time, there are two significant differences. First, it is expected that financial institutions learnt their lessons and second, banks were the cause of the previous crisis while this time they need to be the solution.
                <br><br>
                Over the past few years, a more prudent crisis management together with more supervision and regulation have forced banks to accumulate more capital buffers to prevent future systemic risks. One of these is the countercyclical buffer (CCyB) which can be considered as a credit buffer. This macroprudential cushion has just been fully released by the National Bank of Belgium to allow banks to use this extra capital to absorb any potential loan losses and keep playing their role of source of credit while maintaining a satisfying level of liquidity on the market.
                <br><br>
                On the other side, it is worth underlying that the interest rates remain extremely low while the equity market is highly volatile and uncertain. This is for sure maintaining a high level of attractiveness for some investors.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, it is still a too early stage to assert how the coronavirus crisis will affect the Belgian real estate market but there is no doubt that over the next few months banks and financial authorities will need to monitor the situation very closely.

                 How I Learned to Stop Worrying and <br>Love the Bomb</h2>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                Recently, I had a small fit regarding my relationship with my current client mission.
                <br><br>
                Last year I requested to change the content of the work I was doing (business & functional analysis) and try a mission with a bit more technical meat to it. My BDM was kind enough to find me one as a database analyst (I will spare you the details of my actual tasks).
                <br><br>
                Soon it will be almost one full year since I have been on this mission.
                <br><br>
                I realized am not a fan of the type of content I am working one, even though I was the one requesting it. It’s not ideal, and I would rather be doing something else, something I am better at and more passionate for. I have had a love-hate relationship and lots of highs and lows with it over the past few months. My integrity and work ethic made it so that my own feelings and perceptions about this mission have in no way negatively impacted my relationship with the client (which has already prolonged my contract 2 times).
                <br><br>
                But I don’t necessarily have the luxury of requesting a new mission: and I have requested for one but the odds of receiving it are small, given the current economic context. And I completely understand that. 
                <br><br>
                So, I was faced with a sort of cognitive dissonance between what I would rather be doing and what I am actually doing. This went one for weeks.
                <br><br>
                If you read last month’s newsletter you probably remember that I said I was feeling reluctant to decide anything about my future longer than one month ahead. Including this mission. The result has of course been loads of frustration, anger, long hours, constantly feeling busy, procrastination etc. All the good stuff.
                <br><br>
                In a stroke of genius (and also because I write a lot) I re-read about a powerful lesson I learned last year: the most effective way to do something is to just do it. 
                <br><br>
                Making a decision about how I wanted to show up for myself in this mission had nothing to do with whether I received a new mission or continued on my current one. It had everything to do with the desire to be more of myself, evolve and move forward. 
                <br><br>
                So I just made the decision that I would learn to enjoy what I am doing until I can change my circumstances. Because in the end, that is exactly who I am: I never regretted giving my best, no matter how things ended. 
                <br><br>
                In another article this month I describe a process which helped me but the process is an accessory. There is no right or wrong decision: what makes it right or wrong is the way we think about it.
                <br><br>
                I have been shifting this thought for about a month now and I feel much better than before (albeit, there is still a lot of struggle). I will keep you posted as I go.
                <br><br>
                So this month, I want to invite you to make a decision on something you have been delaying. Make a decision and then make that decision the BEST decision. 
                <br><br>
                Until next month!

            <h2>Last Day of the Week</h2>
            <h6>Written by Andra Mertilos</h6>
            <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Some time ago I learned a powerful concept which completely changed my perspective on time management: being busy means you have a lot of thoughts on your mind and not a lot of things to do. It is your own perception about your to-do list that creates the busyness, not the actual tasks on it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Complete game changer. 
                    <br><br>
                    And so I thought that this concept is really applicable to my own mission: is the content of my mission really boring or is that something I choose to think about it?
                    <br><br>
                    So this month I wanted to share with you what I did differently during the month of July in order to organize my work in such a way that taught me how to enjoy what I was doing and leave everything in order before I left for my holidays. 
                    <br><br>
                    I did this (almost) every Sunday and I found it has tremendously improved the way I look at my to-do list. Maybe you can find some value in it.
                    <br><br>
                    I will first present the process and then I will share some of my thoughts and recommendations on using it.
                 </p>
                    <h5>Last day of the week</h5>
                    <p>
                    Every Sunday, I set some time aside (maximum an hour in my case but it can be more or less for you) to write a generic to-do list. In this list I write everything I have to do, want to do and would like to do. It can be work, mundane things and activities, events, meetings etc. 
                    <br><br>
                    I first start with work tasks and in my case that is easy because we work in sprints so I more or less already know my tasks. These are the main work tasks for which i already have a deadline. I don’t include the day-to-day unexpected tasks that might add up (for that, i always keep a daily buffer of 1-2hrs).
                    <br><br>
                    Then I add mundane activities like: buying groceries, going to a class, giving a training, meeting with a client, going out etc. ANYTHING. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then I add the stuff like: reading a book, studying for a specific skill, working for a specific personal project, watching a documentary/movie, seeing someone I haven’t seen in a long time etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Once everything is written down, I pick the things I have to get done next week, usually the ones for which I have a time constraint. For some of these things I already know how long they will take me to do, especially if it’s work or recurrent activities. Those I put in my calendar already.
                    <br><br>
                    The things I don’t know how long it will take, I just add them on a separate to-do list (I use Google Tasks). 
                    <br><br>
                    And the things I can’t do the next week, I put them in a backlog and check them next Sunday.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s it :-)
                </p>
                    <h5>My thoughts & recommendations</h5>
                    <p>
                    Now I can already hear some backlash on this: <i>Geez, Andra, your life is so boring, organized, mechanical, there is no room for spontaneity</i> or <i>I want to be able to be spontaneous. I want to be able to do whatever I feel like doing in the moment.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    To that my answer is: you do not want to do what you feel like doing in the moment because the way your brain is programmed, the way that you are wired is to just be reactive. And that creates the mindset that your life is happening to you, that it’s not optional, that you have to do all these things that are coming at you, and that you’re at the effect of that. Result ? Feeling busy, overwhelmed, at the expense of everybody else, or worse unhappy, burned out, bummed out, hopeless.
                    <br><br>
                    I would also add that for me <b>spontaneity</b> is of 2 types: saying yes to doing things because it makes other people like you (people-pleasing) or saying yes to doing things for other people because you want to do that for them (people-loving). And for the latter, I have plenty of free time & spontaneity in my calendar, ALWAYS. 
                    <br><br>
                    Second thing to keep in mind is <b>resistance</b>. When you start doing what you planned to do, you will immediately feel resistance. It’s not a maybe, you will FOR SURE feel it. And what most of us do when we feel this resistance is we go: oh, this means stop, this means I am tired, I have to eat something first, or go on a walk or do another important thing that really needs to get done.
                    <br><br>
                    You’re going to pick your priorities, you’re going to pick your project, and then you’re going to plan on hating it the whole time you do it. Because if you plan on loving it, and you plan on being inspired, and you plan on being excited when you do it, you’re going to be very disappointed because that is not what your brain is designed to tell you. Your brain is designed for pleasure. It’s designed for rest. So as soon as you start doing something confusing and challenging, your inclination is going to do the opposite.
                    <br><br>
                    You think that you’re going to feel good, say with something pleasurable like scrolling on your phone, but the real awesome feelings of feeling proud of yourself, feeling accomplished, come when you actually move through the resistance and end up doing ‘the hard thing’. You start getting the sense of self-esteem. You start getting this reliance on yourself. 
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately feeling good about yourself doesn’t make the resistance go away, but you learn how to manage resistance so much better.
                    <br><br>
                    Third thing to keep in mind as you are going through this is you’re going to be tempted to want to go, <i>But wait, I don’t know how much time I should schedule for that </i>. You get to decide how long it takes for everything and the more you start estimating this, the better you will get. Now, I am not saying that you will be dead on your estimation the first time you do it but keep at it.
                    <br><br>
                    BUT if you’re a perfectionist, you’re always going to think that whatever it is you are trying to deliver it’s not good enough. You’re creating a presentation, you’re analyzing data, whatever you’re doing with your work, you’re always going to think: <i>Oh, just a little bit more</i>. Just a little more time to tweak this and to tweak that, and then it never gets done.
                    <br><br>
                    For this I want to propose a concept called <b>B minus work</b>. We’ve all gone to school, and we’re all usually programmed to think: we want the A or the A plus. When in reality, what is helpful for the world, and what allows us to actually move forward and get things done faster is B minus work. And knowing that if it’s good enough, and you just get it done within the time that you say it’s going to get done, it’s actually going to be pretty good.
                    <br><br>
                    The idea is that it’s better to get a B minus than never turn in your project or finish your task. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, if after you turn it in you want to schedule more time to take it to an A, go for it. But don’t prevent yourself from finishing something because it’s not an A yet.
                </p>
                    <h5>Celebrating the small things</h5>
                <p>
                    One last piece of the process, which is optional, depends on your personality and this piece is celebrating your weekly successes.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I personally don’t do this because my motivation is intrinsic (I get validation from myself) but some of you are externally motivated by others. So every Friday or Saturday, talk to someone about your weekly accomplishments, however small, tiny or ‘stupid’ they seem. Share how that makes you feel and why. Let them congratulate you or give you a high five, it is worth it.
                    <br><br>
                    If you end up using this process, let me know how that goes. Please don’t focus on the details or try to make it  too mathematical or methodical. It’s not exact science and if it hurts you more than it helps you (and you’ve already tried using it at least a couple of times) then maybe it’s nor for you. And that’s ok.
                    <br><br>
                    Enjoy!
